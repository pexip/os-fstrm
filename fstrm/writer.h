/**
 * \defgroup fstrm_writer fstrm_writer
 *
 * `fstrm_writer` is an interface for writing Frame Streams data into a byte
 * stream. The underlying byte stream I/O operations are abstracted by the
 * \ref fstrm_rdwr interface. Thus, the `fstrm_writer` interface can be used to
 * write Frame Streams data to any type of output whose read/write operations
 * are wrapped by an `fstrm_rdwr` object.
 *
 * Some basic `fstrm_writer` implementations are already provided in the `fstrm`
 * library. See fstrm_file_writer_init() for an implementation that writes to
 * a regular file, fstrm_tcp_writer_init() for an implementation that writes to
 * a TCP socket, and fstrm_unix_writer_init() for an implementation that writes
 * to a Unix socket.
